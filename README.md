## Overview

This project aims to detect Parkinson’s disease using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier. The model analyzes biomedical voice measurements to classify whether a person is affected by Parkinson’s disease or not.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Parkinson’s Disease Dataset** containing voice-related features such as frequency, jitter, shimmer, and noise ratios, which are commonly used in medical signal analysis.

## Approach

- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Feature selection
- Training an SVM classification model
- Model evaluation using standard classification metrics

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Purpose

This project is developed for academic and learning purposes to understand machine learning applications in healthcare.
